Hi! **file-manager** is a file manager system (for windows) based on *Python 3.7*. It is made by [Syed Basit Ahmad](https://github.com/syedbasitahmad). With this python based file explorer you can view files, folders and perform actions on them. Actions such as moving them, deleting them (permanently or sending them to recycle bin),counting the numbers of characters in a file(with or without space). 

## Modules Used:

1. tkinter
2. os
3. shutil
4. easygui

Python 3. or above is recommended for using this program.
You need to install *send2trash* module first. You can do this by using the following command:

> pip install easygui

* **easygui** EasyGUI is a module for very simple, very easy GUI programming in Python. ... EasyGui provides an easy-to-use interface for simple GUI interaction with a user
* **tkinter** Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications
* **os** The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. OS comes under Python's standard utility modules.
* **shutil** The shutil (or shell utilities) module has functions to let you copy, move, rename, and delete files in your Python programs. To use the shutil functions, you will first need to use import shutil .

## Functions you can perform on files/folders

 1. Delete files/folder permanently
 2. Send files/folder to Recycle Bin
 3. Directly open files from the manager
 4. Expand folders
 5. Move files/folders to another location
 6. Copy files/folders to another location
 7. Count the number of characters in a text file with spaces.
 8. Count the number of characters without spaces
 
 ## I have also included two test cases using pytest.
